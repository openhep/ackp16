This is the code for the numerics and figures for paper


Oleg Antipin, Petar Čuljak, Krešimir Kumerički and Ivica Picek, 
_Radiative neutrino models in light of diphoton signals_,
[arXiv:1606.05163](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05163).


Jupyter/Python notebook ``H750.ipynb`` produces all figures in the paper, apart from the
last one, which is produced by ``LandauPole.ipynb``. Other files contain auxilliary Python
functions.

Feel free to use the code, and if you do so, you are invited to cite our paper above.

If you find bugs, please, report them either through github "Issues" or directly to
authors via email (easily found at [arXiv](http://arXiv.org)).
